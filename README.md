Traffic Sign Detection using Deep Learning
Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for traffic sign detection and classification. The model achieves high accuracy (99.37% validation accuracy) in recognizing 43 different classes of traffic signs from images.

Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing traffic sign images. The dataset should include:

Images resized to 32x32 pixels
43 different traffic sign classes
Properly labeled training and validation sets

  Model Architecture  

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed for traffic sign recognition and follows a sequential architecture with multiple layers for feature extraction and classification. Below is a detailed breakdown of each layer and its purpose:  

1. Convolutional Layers (Feature Extraction) 

 First Convolutional Layer (Conv2D) 
   32 filters (kernels) of size 3×3  
   ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to introduce nonlinearity  
   Input shape: 32×32×3 (RGB images of 32×32 pixels)  
   Followed by a MaxPooling2Dlayer (2×2 pool size) to reduce spatial dimensions and retain important features  

 Second Convolutional Layer (Conv2D) 
   64 filters (kernels) of size 3×3  
   ReLU activation for nonlinear feature learning  
   Another MaxPooling2D(2×2) to downsample feature maps  

 Third Convolutional Layer (Conv2D) 
   128 filters (kernels) of size 3×3  
   ReLU activation for deeper feature extraction  
   Final MaxPooling2D(2×2) to further condense spatial information  

2. Flattening Layer 
 Converts the 3D feature maps into a 1D feature vector  
 Prepares the data for input into fully connected (dense) layers  

3. Fully Connected (Dense) Layers (Classification) 

 First Dense Layer 
   256 neurons with ReLU activation  
   Processes highlevel features for classification  

 Dropout Layer (Regularization) 
   Dropout rate of 0.25 (25% of neurons are randomly deactivated during training)  
   Prevents overfitting by reducing dependency on specific neurons  

 Output Layer (Dense) 
   43 neurons (corresponding to the 43 traffic sign classes)  
   Softmax activationto produce probability distribution over classes  


This architecture achieves high accuracy (99.37% validation accuracy) while efficiently learning discriminative features from traffic sign images.
